# Warnings

Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesnâ€™t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example, one might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.

There are two stages in warning control: first, each time a warning is issued, a determination is made whether a message should be issued or not; next, if a message is to be issued, it is formatted and printed using a user-settable hook.
