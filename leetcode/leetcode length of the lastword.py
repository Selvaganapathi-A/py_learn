## Length of Last Word

# Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

# A word is a maximal
# substring
#  consisting of non-space characters only.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "Hello World"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.


# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
# There will be at least one word in s.
